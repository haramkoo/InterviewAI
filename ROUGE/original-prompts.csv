"Yes. Yeah, actually, whenever I get together with friends of mine who don't work for newspapers, I realize how much more fun I have than they do. There are a lot more pressures. I have to worry about budgets. I have to worry about the careers of other people. But the reality is I come into the newsroom every morning with about 10 things that I want to get done in terms of coverage. I can influence coverage of everything from how we write about music, to how we write about Supreme Court nominees, to how we cover the most interesting city in America. That's a blast. You can't complain too much about that."
"To tell you the truth, I started to cry. I was a little disappointed. There's some financial effects, and then there's also just - it's kind of demeaning to be considered basically a second-class citizen. That's how I feel. You know, I pay taxes. I'm a citizen. I'm a grown woman with a partner of 10 years and a 22-month-old child that I've adopted. My partner had the baby. And we're a family with a house, and we're really like a boring couple. And yet, New York state doesn't consider us a family."
"Right. Which, of course, supposes that these are not objective. The funny thing is that the GOP is assuming - as I said - that this will necessarily favor Hillary Clinton. I don't think the Clintons - they've been silent on this, but speaking to their associates, I don't think they make any such assumption at all. And already these projects have also drawn fire from the left, who fear that it could go quite the other way."
"To some extent, China is more able than the United States to set ambitious targets for things like renewable energy. But I would say in the last eight to ten years in the United States, there has been a tremendous amount of path-breaking work going on at the state level, particularly in California. And some of the policies that California has put into place, such as its very ambitious solar energy incentives have become the model for China."
There are so many incredible writers out there on Twitter and so many really compelling firsthand accounts of the big news stories this year that it makes for a really interesting way to recap some of those big events.
"You know, that would be a difficult one to impose and to regulate. I think the strength of the lobbying law is that it is so narrowly defined - covering the most important piece of lobbying, which is contacting Congressmen and covered officials."
"I think it is backfiring on President Trump's critics. When you overshoot the mark and you turn the dial to 11 on every single issue, I think the American public starts to tune you out."
"Thank you, Steve. Nice to be with you."
"I think, frankly, what I get from a lot of them is that my politics are their politics. I'd be the better candidate and I'd be the better governor. But it's really someone else's turn. And I think the problem with that is that the people who need a change, the ones who can't wait, aren't a part of that conversation. The establishment have all the options and all the influence and connections to protect their interests, frankly, no matter who is in power from whatever party. But everybody else, in my view, is the responsibility of the chief executive, and that's the responsibility I'm looking to assume."
Thank you.
"So, it's certainly not a one-man show and if there's one dominant personality, I would say that today it's Omar Suleiman."
"One day, the Brelands were called out to China Lake to the weapons research station out there to do some research with the U.S. Navy's dolphin program, training dolphins to do things like locate submarines or warn of enemy attack, things like that. And this was run by Bob Bailey, who was kind of an animal behaviorist of his own. And he was convinced to come work with the Brelands at the I.Q. Zoo."
"Basically, the town west from Main Street, you could stand on Main Street and look west and see the next town, which is 10 miles away, which you shouldn't be able to do. Things were leveled. It was debris about four feet deep. There was a picture in the, I think, the New York Times or somewhere that showed on top Hiroshima and on the bottom Greensburg. And it was very similar."
"Oh, that's central to it for sure. What we know, of course, is that some of those folks have severe disabilities by virtue of addiction or mental illness or physical or developmental disability. So we've learned they need permanent housing would support services. The old way of attempting to deliver services when a person's on the street or living in a shelter, you can't do it more ineffectively or more expensively than that. And what we're learning is when you provide, actually, stability and a place to live, that housing itself has a therapeutic impact on folk. Those of us who have never been homeless, we take our housing for granted. But for a homeless person, for the first time, they could actually relax. And when a person's relaxed in the setting of stability and security, they're much more amenable to receiving some of those mental health services or addiction services that they might have rejected had they been on the street."
"You know, I think they were, in many cases. And I reported from Iraq from 2006 through 2008. And, Robert, I dug up some of my old stories, and one was from 2006. And General George Casey, the top commander at the time, predicted that in the next year and a half or so, the Iraqi forces would be independent and need very little help from the Americans. Then I found a story from a year later, 2007, and a major report found it would take another 12 to 18 months. So a competent and independent Iraqi military was always just over the horizon."
"Well, one of the biggest changes is accountability, the way people keep track of where their money went and how it's being used. Also social networking, the way people connect with other people who are giving or the organizations themselves. And also just the physical ways that people are donating. People can donate by texting the word kettle to the Salvation Army, a quick $5 donation via your mobile phone. It doesn't really get any easier than that."
"Well, with respect to polls, my guess is 99 percent of Americans have never even heard of this agency, and I would defy you to find a poll otherwise. To some extent, it's hard to judge precisely what they have done. Again, there are very important laws that need to be enforced. I think in some respects, in certain cases, they have, but in other cases, they've really let us down."
Correct. Discovered that we had it.
"I think there is a small connection. It's not the major reason that rates are going up, but I suspect that chairman Greenspan wants to make sure that inflation is well-controlled on the day he walks out of office, both to protect his own legacy and to make life a little easier for his successor, whoever that may be."
"I think it will be. It'll be very disorienting, at first, because - you know, people are used to turning on their computers and seeing a certain something. And in the case of Windows, that certain something for 20 years has been a desktop environment. Now, suddenly, that desktop environment isn't there anymore. There aren't the icons, the folders; the things that we're all used to, in Windows. There are these colorful tiles. And they have to know how to get from those files to the desktop, where they can do their productive work."
"Well, a lot of things have happened in the interim. Two of the prosecutors who were assigned to the case became judges during this period, believe it or not. That's how long it's been, and they had to reconfigure the prosecution team. Phil Spector has had three different sets of lawyers, and now he has Bruce Cutler. And Bruce Cutler was the lawyer in New York who represented John Gotti; he's kind of known as a mob lawyer, a very enthusiastic, very flamboyant lawyer in the courtroom. He'll be something else to watch when you're watching on television."
That's right.
"It's not at all unexpected. If anything, investors and some people in the auto industry had been begging Ford to make this step. General Motors Corp. earlier this year did something quite similar. And it's really the only way Ford can get its workers out of the existing UAW contract in a way that's amenable to the union. They have a contract and if they wanted to fire these workers any other way, they would have to continue paying them."
"Well, I don't change my views regardless of who it is I'm speaking to or working with. I have never made one call or made one office visit on behalf of a client, and I don't intend to because that's not my role. So I don't think there's any conflict at all."
"Most of the tanks are in fact gone now. Most of the tanks that were around the Government House, most of them are gone now. And the presence here today is a lot less than it was two weeks ago in the days immediately following the coup. I think - I think the military feels pretty confident right now. I think they feel like they're in charge, that the bad news that they thought might follow this, that some Thaksin supporters might rise up and say, hey, we're not on board with this thing, that hasn't happened yet. So I think the military is feeling pretty good in fact that a lot of the military has been brought back to barracks, sent back to barracks, I think that's an indication that they're feeling pretty confident."
So we tested that.
"So in Louisiana, they had a practice on the books that meant that felony convictions could happen with a split jury, so 10-2 or 11-1. And voters said, no, we're going to be like the rest of the country, with the exception of Oregon, and we're going to have unanimous juries for felony convictions."
"One person, actually the aide to Ted Kennedy. Now, the reason I got into Ted Kennedy's office is that he has a book coming out on the adventures of his dog, named Splash. Yes."
"Well, as I understand it right now, the vast majority of the money being put up would be public. Private investors might put up as little as 3 percent equity in some of these partnerships. The Treasury would add more equity from the TARP funds it got from Congress - you know, the $700 billion, which is now down to 300 billion after all the injections of capital into the banks. So the private investors don't have a lot of skin in the game. And the purchases of the assets would be further financed by these low-interest loans from the Fed or the FDIC. Those are likely to be called non-recourse loans, which means that the toxic assets lose money after they're purchased. The private investors would lose only the 3 percent of money they put down, or maybe 10 percent, if they invested that much, and the government would lose the rest. So the taxpayers are on the hook. But if the toxic assets rise in value, there's the prospect of big gains for private investors. Now, some people suggest the downside to taxpayers may be small because these toxic assets are undervalued right now and are unlikely to fall much further but have a bigger chance of increasing in value. We'll just have to see."
"We're on the ballot in 11 states, and we have ballot access in another number of states. So we have a total ballot access either as a write-in or appearing on the ballot in 34 to 35 states. By the time we get to Election Day, it will be 43 to 45."
"You know, it's such a fine balance, because what I like to do at first is assess their financial situation. If they have a family and they're pretty much short on cash and they don't have a big income, you know, if they're stirring at a contract from Lithuania or Italy, or wherever that is presenting yourself at $20,000 a month, I have them take a long look at that and say, are you aware of what you could possibly be risking? And more often than not, they always say to me, well, I feel like I belong, and just in my gut, and I want to take that chance. Believe it or not, a handful of my guys have, in fact, turned down big contracts, go on to the D-League, and have gone on to make the league and make good money."
"They are known for a couple of different things. Bob Komer's particularly notable for his work on a grazing settlement between the Bureau of Land Management and a Wyoming rancher. And in that case, that was actually the subject of an Inspector General's report which cited Mr. Komer for pressuring rank and file employees to reach a settlement which was seen as favorable to the rancher in question. And then, Mark McEwen is known more for being a very fierce proponent of property rights and pushing for ranchers and other individuals to have their property rights recognized by the federal government."
Good to talk to you. Thank you very much for having me tonight.
"I think that argument is silly. The harder questions really relate to in addition to trying to negotiate to save some lives, was there more that might have been done to encourage others to flee to Romania, to avoid being ghettoized? Could lives, more lives, have been saved if more emphasis had been put on that? But I don't criticize Kastner for entering into negotiation in the hope of trying to save lives."
It's still totally unreal when I think about it. It feels so weird to be able to just kind of buy things when I want them or need them.
Thank you.
"Car buying, there's been a--it's hard to look at, you know, this momentary flash because of gasoline prices. SUV sales have gone down--I think it's about 15 percent over two years. It's been a fairly steady--I mean, I think it's more leveling off. People are leaving the bigger SUVs, going to crossovers, that sort of thing. It's been a leveling off. It's still going to be a significant part of our market, even though they're in some disfavor right now. Pickup trucks and SUVs and minivans are all called light trucks, and they're going to continue to make up almost half of all the vehicles sold in the country. What auto dealers, at least in New England, have told me is that they're not seeing so much people saying, `Get me out of this SUV, and get me into a Toyota Prius.' They're seeing, `Get me out of this big SUV, and get me into a small SUV,' such as the Ford Escape."
"Yeah, I think that--one of the things I think has happened is that there have been several different movements happening at the same time. But if you'd go onto a Google site and you tried to find--put down May Day or May 1st Immigrant Demonstration, you'll be referred to websites of groups that are, let's say, largely outside the mainstream. I mean, in other words, what you're really seeing, I think, is a battle between a sort of extremist nativist position on the one hand, andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦"
"The thing that's most likely is that the female actually ovulates over a fairly long period, so all of the embryos are actually at different stages of development. One of the things that's important is the male that mates with the female first has a big advantage, as far as having the embryo that reaches the size where it starts to kill and eat its siblings. And one thing that's very interesting about sand tigers in captivity, when mating is being observed the males actually form a dominance hierarchy. And the dominant male actually guards the female and prevents other males from mating with her. And that might be a strategy to actually ensure that he's the one, the dominant male is the one to fertilize those earliest eggs which are then going to become the cannibals."
Thank you.
"Good morning, Steve."
"Well, you know, Congress created that tax break early last year when foreclosures and short sales, they were just pounding down the housing prices. And, you know, very few people want to buy a house when they can see that the prices are still dropping. So Congress thought it really needed to do something to step in and help. And the idea here was that if taxpayers would just help make housing a little more affordable, young families could buy houses, and that would start to put a floor under prices. So, Realtors predicted that once the prices started to rise on starter homes, the whole market could stabilize and heal itself from the bottom up. And it helped a bit, but it's just not clear at this point that those gains are sustainable. After that tax credit expired at the end of April, the market crashed again. We saw new home sales plunge 33 percent in May, and that's very discouraging. Now, the companies that track real estate say the prices are starting to slide again in a lot of cities."
Right.
"Well, it looks like the rest of the ocean. I mean, the surface of the ocean is disturbed by way of which, which reflect light. So satellites can see it. Only like spy planes and low-flying aircrafts can actually see down into the water. But some fishermen can spot these large agglomerations of debris that the ocean has knitted together. We've picked up one, weighed a couple hundred pounds. It had a toothbrush in it. Even though, it was mostly composed of net and tarps and stuff like that."
This is just a few months in that long path.
"Well, you know, I reviewed for years myself and then I still do occasionally, and you can kind of get into the habit of destroying things. It's much more interesting and much more difficult to try and show why good things are good. You know, there's a thrill to kind of trying to destroy something, and David feels it."
Thanks for having me.
Cool.
"There'll be - well, it's about an 18-minute mile pace, which is a very slow run, but a pretty decent pace when you're walking, especially for 26 miles."
"Ã¢â‚¬Â¦including our colleagues in Malaysia and Singapore. We're getting rather close to Thailand. They're not sure quite how far it went. But this dispatch said things about the Thai foreign minister, questioning his sanity. It was really not the sort of material that you would want to see distributed that widely. The tradition was eventually brought to a halt in 2006 after a very funny valedictory dispatch from our ambassador to Rome, Sir Ivor Roberts."
"So what you might expect are some short-term disruptions. But long-term, these things tend to fix themselves surprisingly quickly."
"Well, that's a good question. They weren't teaching very much. They were exposing their students to a little bit of anatomical dissection and maybe a little bit of physiology lab. And some of the conditions that he found were truly atrocious. And his main criticisms were that they had very poor clinical education, very poor clinical facilities. And what Flexner wanted to do was to have students understand where the knowledge came from and how it was derived, not mainly to learn memorization of facts given in a lecture."
"Yes. I mean, I think we didn't really have a clear conception of what we would find. So most of the previous studies of recent selection in humans have focused on just a handful of genes where there was some prior biological expectation that these might be targets of selection. So one of these, for example, is the lactase gene that's responsible for metabolizing milk in some populations, including Europeans. And our approach is different, because it really allowed us to scan the whole genome in sort of an unbiased way and try to get a sense of what kinds of biological processes are evolving and how much evolution is going on over this very recent time scale."
"I was actually more irritated with myself. It was getting windy and a storm front was coming in. And so I was looking for somewhere to get out of the wind. And then I found a big pine tree and just started pulling in needles. And then I saw some willow trees, and so I started cutting branches and then basically just tried to cover up. I was wet from going in and out of streams so I stayed awake all night, as I did for the next four nights."
Thank you. Glad to be with you.
We do not have enough attorneys. We need more.
"Oh, they've got quite a few boats done got broke loose and went elsewhere. I don't see none (unintelligible) yet. But a lot of ropes got popped. And it was - I'm glad that that's all what happened around here, because it could be a lot worse. And it's not over yet. We're still experiencing a lot of water on the outside. You know, these levees are holding it back, but I don't trust the levees."
"Well, I think that's part of it and what John has said is that that's one of a lot of reasons why he left the paper. I think it would be a mistake to assume that John left in protest. John and I are very close. We talk probably more than we talk to each other's wives. And I can tell you, it's not the only reason he left. He left because he's been running newspapers--this is his third newspaper--he's been running newspapers for more than two decades, and I think he wanted to do something different. I feel that the two of us have spent--we've been partners for the last five years. I know all of the things we've assembled. I know what has to be protected. I don't think of it as much of a firestorm as other people do. Maybe I'm kidding myself, but that's not the way I see it."
"Well, it hasn't been that long ago that people - also high-level members of ISIS or the Islamic State had access to Turkey and were treated at Turkish hospitals. So we know, for example, of about one high-level ISIS fighter who was there just six months ago."
"A lot of them come from West Africa, but they really come from across sub-Saharan Africa. We talked to people from Liberia, from Burkina Faso, from Senegal, from the Gambia. It really was a huge range of people from across West Africa."
"Hello, Alex. It's nice to be here."
Thanks for having me.
"Remember; there have been news reports for a few days now that three Trump campaign advisers or aides met with an FBI asset in the course of the campaign. People close to the investigation say that was because the FBI didn't want word to get out that Trump or the Trump campaign was under investigation for possible collusion with Russians in the course of 2016. So as opposed to calling those aides in and interviewing them quite publicly or taking other steps, they sent an informant in to talk to those folks. Now, this is a counterintelligence investigation, not just a criminal one. And in counterintelligence investigations, the FBI and other government agencies often use these kinds of informants to go in and gather information secretly often to protect the privacy of people who are being investigated. And, Don, these require very high-level approvals at Justice and the FBI. They're not just something one guy can do."
"Well, being a porter on Everest is probably the best job going ,if you're a Sherpa in the Khumbu region and you want to stay and work where you live. You can make between $2- and $6,000 in a climbing season. You know, this is in a country where the median income is still around $550 or $600 a year. So the guys who are strong enough and fit enough to do this work make enough money to support not only their own families, but much of their extended families."
"Hi, Madeleine."
"The other man, Majed Hameed--who worked for us and also for Al-Arabiya television, was detained--and it seems he was detained because sometime earlier there'd been some vague allegations made by unknown third parties. But again, we never had any specific information about why he seemed to have attracted some suspicion."
"Well, John, it comes in at about $300 billion over the five-year length of the farm bill - big chunk of change, lots of money."
"Well, that's been a serious issue raised by the mayor here. He feels that the money that he wants from the central government in Baghdad for reconstruction efforts has not flowed as freely as he had hoped. And if you drive around the city, you can see the evidence that mortars fell like rain here just a few months ago. There are many, many crumbled buildings, buildings that need to be rebuilt. The mayor says he's waiting for $33 million to come in that was promised to him by the Baghdad government that he has yet to see. So it's quite obvious that it's a city that seen a lot of bloodshed in the past, and hopefully what we've seen this weekend and early this week is not the start of a new trend here."
"That's right, yes, absolutely. It's a malignant form of cancer."
"No, I don't get that far. I type in Falun Gong at Yahoo.com and a little pop-up comes up saying, Alert, the document contains no data."
"You expect a machine like this to have problems, you know, growing pains as you get it to work operationally."
"Yeah, we do. I think over the last 20 years we've taken in a huge number of people into the city. We have 50 different religions in the city. I mean, I'm sure that's the case of many other cities as well, but we've become a very diverse city, and that's enriched our culture."
"Some of these boats, in particular, are in bad shape. And some of the men, in particular, are in bad shape. They have running sores. They have bedbug outbreaks. And some people are very afraid of their captains."
That's...
"Yeah. Twenty-five percent more, yes."
"Not yet. He says he plans to fight the ruling. SCA is based in Dallas, and it's gone to state district court in Dallas to ask that the arbitration award be turned into a final judgment. If that happens within the next 30 to 60 days, then SCA can collect the money. If he still refuses, the company can seize money from bank account, stocks, cash, jewelry, his vacation home in Hawaii even."
"Ultimately, I think baby steps. One, just creating a coalition that is biblically based but also shares the compassion that Jesus displayed in the Scriptures, an individual who cares for the poor, who's concerned for the outcast and the marginalized but, at the same time, doesn't compromise his divinity in order to show compassion. I think what we often are asked to do is to make those things mutually exclusive."
"Oh, absolutely. Interestingly enough, you know, two of the safest cities in the United States are San Diego and El Paso, which are both border towns. In the '90s, you know, it was kind of chaotic along the San Diego border. Significant progress was made and it's now one of the more secure border crossing points that we have. And you've seen, I think, a lot of this violence and this illegal activity now moving to Arizona. So there are certainly some things that could be learned and I think Arizona can gain some additional measures."
"Well, it's a good question. I mean, it does get to - are we giving people the kind of news that matters to them? Obviously, a lot of this conversation gets tangled up quite quickly in national politics and Trump and the election. And I don't think the Daily News story is about that. But one of the things I think we learned in that conversation is that a lot of the journalism that a lot of journalists were doing, which is about the sort of horse race of politics or the sort of process of politics wasn't really what people wanted to read. I mean, they wanted to read about taxes. They wanted to read about health care. They wanted to read about school policy. And those stories weren't being done. So I think there's some fault in a very broad way in terms of what people are writing about. But this is the case that we now have to engage in."
"So certainly the longer this goes on, the greater the concerns that it could drag in more tribes and more men into this conflict and spread beyond that northern district of Hassiba(ph). There have been attempts at tribal mediation, which went rather wrong. Yesterday when the house of Sadek al-Ahmar, where the mediation was going on, came under attack and mortar fire left several of those tribal mediators - and they were prominent sheiks - injured, and reports that even that some of them have been killed."
"Twenty years ago, when I was a young professor about to teach a course on African-American fiction, I set about to find a forgotten or undiscovered classic by a woman writer. I wanted a book that would hold its own against such urban classics as ""Invisible Man"" or ""Native Son,"" an older book that would complement the newer works by Toni Morrison and Alice Walker or the recently republished novels of Zora Neale Hurston. What I discovered was Ann Petry's magnificent 1946 novel ""The Street"". Described by some as an urban ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" minus any redemption and hope, ""The Street"" tells the story of Lutie Johnson and her 8-year-old son during the last years of the Second World War. Lutie is a young, hard-working single mother in urban America trying to get ahead in a world that ignores and exploits her. I saw her struggles and determination as both inspiring and doomed. In striving to provide for her son's future, she often ignored his immediate needs and fears. This book shook me so much that whenever I taught it in class, later that night I would slip into my sleeping sons' bedrooms to watch them and make silent promises. Even now, whenever I finish it, I calculate how old the main character's son would be and wonder what sort of life he had. I care deeply about these characters. They are real to me. This book creates a lot of discussion, often uncomfortable, in my literature classes. It makes us confront difficult questions about race and class. Who has access to the American Dream? Why do some characters make it but Lutie doesn't? Petry wants her readers to see the two sides of America, the gleaming and moneyed suburbs, where she herself was raised, and the struggles of black women in Harlem where she moved after her marriage. ""The Street"" is a book that raises passion in readers, and in me. It is as relevant today as when it was written in the 1940s. Particularly now, with the upcoming presidential election, it makes us think about what it was like to be a single mother raising a black son to believe he was worthy of all the best this country can offer. I can't think of a better place to start a national discussion about the audacity of hope than with this undiscovered classic, as fresh and moving now as the day it was published."
Thank you very much.
Hi.
"There were 9,000 people. I've never seen so many bikes in one location. Just phenomenal."
"Well, it was helpful to me, and I had even more fun writing ""Heat"" than I had writing ""Cold."""
"Things have improved since the first early weeks when people didn't have toilets, when there wasn't any water. But things haven't significantly improved in recent months. Things are pretty much at a plateau. People are living in tents, they're living under tarps, they're living in just shacks that they constructed out of whatever they could pull together and a lot of people are just stuck at sort of that level. There are some organized camps which are somewhat better in that they're all the same type of tents - they're better tents, they're stronger - but then they were trying to evacuate one of those during this approaching hurricane because it was on a flood plain and there was concerns and that turned into complete chaos as some people wanted to be evacuated, some people felt it was a trick. So things remain incredibly tenuous for people. People feel incredibly vulnerable and there's a sense that things aren't moving forward, that they're just stuck in these camps and it's unclear when they're going to get out."
"Yes, yes."
Good morning.
"Well, the thing that makes Nashville unique is the location of Bridgestone Arena - right in downtown in the middle of everything, next to Broadway where all the neon lights are, all the restaurants, everything. So imagine yourself walking down the street. You see these neon lights. You smell barbecue. You smell all these great foods coming (inaudible). You hear live music as you're walking into the arena. So just that alone helps paint the picture of how you can get excited go into this game. And then after the game, what makes it different, too, you're right there on the streets - all the bars, all the honky-tonks, all the live music, restaurants. During the game, intermissions - it's not just advertisements playing on a Megatron. You have live music. So you have guys like Charles Esten from Nashville playing live music there. Sometimes you'll have people from different major bands, as well. You have country music stars singing the national anthem. It is a totally unique experience in every single way."
"This, until the completion of the investigation of the unfortunate event yesterday in Qana."
"Well, if you read Ted Turner's vision--and he's now really no longer involved in the running of CNN--but if you read what he had to say back when it was launched, he sort of described it as a newspaper of the air. He said, `You know, broadcast networks are really too much like headline wire service copy.' In a sense, that's what much of the time cable news functions as. They give you brief bursts of updates. In fact, MSNBC now every 15 minutes gives you an update of the news. And in between they're trying to figure out ways to keep you watching. So they'll do reported pieces. They'll do a lot of interviews. There are a lot of talk shows. And to be honest, there's a lot of things that we would classify as kind of pulpy, quasi-tabloid, quasi-celebrity news; anything that's sort of waiting for the next great crisis. And when crisis hits, people turn to cable, they particularly turn to CNN. And when crisis abates, they kind of tune it out. They don't need it as much."
And they don't.
Good.
"Well, it's actually very significant. The Hispanic vote in Florida in a primary can be 10 to 12 percent of that vote. And as we saw in the 2004 Republican primary when Mel Martinez won the nomination, a very high turn-out in Miami-Dade where the vote moved in a large direction towards one candidate, it can be very telling and very important to building a vote margin."
"Well, you know, officials say that Rahman was killed last week in Waziristan, Pakistan in this CIA drone strike, and they seem fairly confident that they got him. That said, you know, there are often reports about drone strikes against core al-Qaida leaders and then these guys end up surfacing later. And in fact, that actually happened to Rahman last year. They said he was dead and clearly he wasn't. And he was reported killed this time in a very remote part of Pakistan. So, it's unclear how the U.S. can be so sure they got him. The officials we spoke to seemed pretty confident but they wouldn't say whether they had DNA evidence or something more dispositive like that. Usually, the way we find out definitively is al-Qaida announces it, and that hasn't happened yet."
"That's exactly right. There's deep fear about this crisis spreading to Italy and expanding further. There are reports this morning, Renee, that Italy has agreed to let the International Monetary Fund monitor its economic reform efforts. Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has been under intense pressure to move very quickly on really a broad series of reforms, including very controversial issues, such as privatizing state-run Italian companies, radically reforming the government pension system, labor market changes to make it easier to fire workers. You know, these are all measures that are deeply unpopular at home. And Berlusconi, like his Greek colleague, is under mounting pressure to step down and hand power to an emergency government. Italy's government is in crisis. And really the whole issue of expanding the eurozone's rescue firewall is to try to better protect against the possibility that Italy's troubles will only get worse in coming months."
"Basically, she prayed for the university. She prayed for the students' continued success. She prayed over the losses that we've all experienced. And she prayed basically just for the preservation of our university and for our students to continue to do well."
Thank you.
"Good, thanks."
"Well, I'm fine, of course, it's an awkward position to expect philosophy to answer a question once and for all. I mean if we could answer questions once for all, we would be out of business once we turn the answers in. If I'm to be guide toward good decision making, I fear that many will be, not only frustrated at the end, but confirmed in their suspicion that philosophy's limits are nerve racking."
