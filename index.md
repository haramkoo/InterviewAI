## AI Interviewer

### About

With the advent of machine learning, it has become increasingly clear that AI is capable of completing tasks that were hitherto considered only possible by human minds. We are now pushing the boundaries of what AI can do with natural language processing (NLP), from summarizing pages of text to keeping up a conversation with a human. Our project aims to join those on the frontier of machine learning by creating an AI Interviewer. There are two main problems to address here: first, whether creating such an interviewer will be possible, and second, whether it will be any good.

### Project

This is a research project; the focus is less on developing new software and more on refining pre-existing ones to suit our needs. Our research objective is first and foremost to see whether modern AI models can replicate the job of an interviewer to a satisfactory enough degree that we could feasibly use it for actual interviews. Should we succeed, there could be a use for the AI Interviewer, such as replacing journalists in dangerous locations like warzones. Moreover, the success of our AI Interviewer could aid in other research projects, such as AI to help writers, AI call center representatives, or any other position that involves asking questions or guiding conversations based on context.
